# Virtual Machine Tools

The programs distributed with this repository enable users to quickly configure and **use virtual machines as development and test environment** on a Linux workstation. In conjunction all programs in the [bin/](bin) sub-directory build a tool-chain to bootstrap many virtual machine instances in a very customizable way. 

The tool-chain is based on software available in all modern Linux distributions: 

* Linux [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org) is used as virtualization platform.
* [Libvirt](http://libvirt.org/) is used as generic interface on top of KVM, and to manage the virtual machine network.
* [SSH](http://www.openssh.com/), [Rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/), and [SSHfs](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html) allows access the virtual machine instances.

### Prerequisites 

Install following packages on Debian:

```bash
>>> sudo apt -y install libvirt-daemon-system libvirt-dev libvirt-clients \
                        virt-manager virt-viewer virt-top virtinst \
                        qemu-utils qemu-kvm libguestfs-tools ovmf
```

Install following package group on Fedora:

```bash
>>> sudo dnf -y install @virtualization
```

Enable your user to manage virtual machines (re-login to activate these group rights):

```bash
>>> sudo usermod -a -G libvirt,kvm `id -un`      
```

Configure the libvirt service to run with your user ID (here illustrated with ID jdow):

```bash
>>> sudo grep -e '^user' -e '^group' /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
user = "jdow"
group = "jdow"
# restart the Libvirt service daemon
>>> sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

### Environment

The shell script â†´ [source_me.sh](source_me.sh) adds the tool-chain in this repository to your shell environment:

```bash
>>> source source_me.sh
```

It will add the [bin/](bin/) sub-directory to your `PATH` and define several additional environment variables cf. [var/aliases/env.sh](var/aliases/env.sh).

# Usage

The [docs/](docs) sub-directory includes all documentation required to us this tool-chain:

* The [network](docs/network.md) document explains the setup of the virtual machine network.
* The [image](docs/image.md) document describes how to create re-usable template virtual machine images.
* The [instance](docs/instance.md) document show how to use virtual machine images to create any number of virtual machine instances.
