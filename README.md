# Virtual Machine Tools

The programs distributed within this repository enable users to quickly configure and **use virtual machines as development and test environment** on a Linux workstation. Programs in the [bin/](bin) sub-directory build a tool-chain to bootstrap multiple virtual machine instances in a very customizable way. 

The tool-chain is based on software available in all modern Linux distributions: 

* Linux [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org) is used as virtualization platform.
* [Libvirt](http://libvirt.org/) is used as generic interface on top of KVM, and to manage the virtual machine network.
* [SSH](http://www.openssh.com/), [Rsync](http://rsync.samba.org/), and [SSHfs](http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html) allows access the virtual machine instances.

## Prerequisites 

```bash
# check for hardware support
LC_ALL=C lscpu | grep Virtualization
# check kernel support
zgrep CONFIG_KVM /proc/config.gz
# Debian packages
sudo apt -y install \
       clustershell \
       libguestfs-tools \
       libvirt-clients \
       libvirt-daemon-system \
       libvirt-dev \
       ovmf \
       qemu-kvm \
       qemu-utils \
       ruby \
       virt-manager \
       virt-top \
       virt-viewer \
       virtinst
# Fedora/CentOS packages
sudo dnf -y install \
      @virtualization \
      clustershell
# ArchLinux packages
sudo pacman -Sy --noconfirm \
       bridge-utils \
       dnsmasq \
       ebtables \
       iptables \
       libvirt \
       openbsd-netcat \
       ruby \
       vde2 \
       virt-install \
       virt-manager \
       virt-viewer \
       qemu \
       qemu-block-rbd
```

Enable your user to manage virtual machines, **re-login** to activate these group rights:

```bash
>>> sudo usermod -a -G libvirt,kvm `id -un`      
```

Configure the libvirt service to run with your user ID (here illustrated with ID jdow):

```bash
>>> sudo grep -e '^user' -e '^group' /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf
user = "jdow"
group = "jdow"
# restart the Libvirt service daemon
>>> sudo systemctl restart libvirtd
```

For host access to guests on non-isolated, bridged networks, enable the libvirt NSS module:

```bash
>>> grep hosts /etc/nsswitch.conf
hosts: files libvirt ...
```

### Environment

The shell script â†´ [source_me.sh](source_me.sh) adds the tool-chain in this repository to your shell environment:

```bash
>>> source source_me.sh
```

It will add the [bin/](bin/) sub-directory to your `PATH` and define several additional environment variables cf. [var/aliases/env.sh](var/aliases/env.sh).

## Usage

The [docs/](docs) sub-directory includes all documentation required to use this tool-chain:

* [docs/network.md](docs/network.md) explains the setup of the **virtual machine network**
* [docs/image.md](docs/image.md) describes how to create re-usable **virtual machine images** 
  (aka templates)
* [docs/instance.md](docs/instance.md) shows how to use virtual machine images to create 
  any number of **virtual machine instances** for development and testing
* [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md) explains in great detail how to efficiently 
  interact with virtual machine instances
* [docs/nodeset.md](docs/nodeset.md) exemplifies operation of multiple virtual 
  machine instance

### Provisioning

Configure a virtual machine instance with a Configuration Management System:

* [docs/chef.md](docs/chef.md) describes how to us the `chef-instance` command 
  to execute `chef-client` in a virtual machine instance.
* [docs/salt.md](docs/salt.md) describes how to create a configuration to use 
  Salt SSH with `salt-instance`
